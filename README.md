The [CompOmics](http://www.compomics.com) Crowd system is an attempt to make crowd-based science accessible through means of a simple screensaver.

## Summary

Mass Spectrometry based proteomics is facing exciting times. With both hardware reaching incredible capacities and the advent of novel insights in gene transcription and translation products, there come heaps of unidentified sequences in spectra. As it is unknown what these peptides look like, it is near impossible to infer the true identity of these spectra through sequence database searches. Fortunately, there is the option to turn out attention towards true de novo sequence, eliminating the need of prior knowledge on the peptide.

The downside is that the processing becomes a lot more complex. In order to find sufficient processing potential, compomics-crowd reaches out to all users that want to participate and aid science in this endeavor. This can be done simply by downloading the screensaver and just letting us tap in your idle cpu time, whenever you're away from the keyboard!
